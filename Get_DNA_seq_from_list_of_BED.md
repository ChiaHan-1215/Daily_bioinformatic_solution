#### Goal: Get DNA sequence from list of bed file using UCSC genome brower. 
Our goal is to extract DNA sequences for regions specified in a BED file using the UCSC Genome Browser. 

The BED file lists each interval by chromosome, start, and end coordinates, and we use the browserâ€™s sequence retrieval tools to download the matching FASTA entries.

#### Code/protocol:

1.  Prepare your BED file: Ensure your BED file is properly formatted with chromosome, start, and end coordinates. 
2. Upload the BED file as a custom track: Navigate to the UCSC Genome Browser's Add Custom Tracks page and upload your BED file. 
3. Access the Table Browser: Go to the Table Browser from the Genome Browser's interface. 
4. Select your custom track: In the Table Browser, select the custom track you just uploaded. 
5. Choose sequence output format: In the Table Browser, choose "sequence" as the output format. You can also choose other formats like FASTA.
